> To **create** new **extension** or **theme** run any of the following command: 

```bash 
gulp create --path <ex-example || THEME> 

gulp create --p <ex-example || THEME> 

## if you don not have gulp as a global package you can use npm to do the same 

npm run gulp create -- --p <ex-example || THEME> 
```

> To **run the development server** for any of the extension theme use the below : 
 
```bash 
gulp --path <ex-example> 

gulp --p <ex-example> 

## if you don not have gulp as a global package you can use npm to do the same 

npm run gulp -- --p <ex-example || THEME> 
```
> To **run the storybook for all components we have use the below :

```


> To **compile** the SASS files for any **extension** or **theme** use the below :

```

> To **compile** and move any **extension** inside any specific **theme** you need to provide the destination param like the below : 
 
```bash 
gulp compile --path <ex-example> --dest  <THEME>

gulp compile --p <ex-example> --dest <THEME>

## if you don not have gulp as a global package you can use npm to do the same

```

> To **compile all** the **extensions** under specific **theme** use the below : 
 
```bash 
gulp compile --path <ex-example || THEME> --all

gulp compile --p <ex-example || THEME> --all 

## if you don not have gulp as a global package you can use npm to do the same 

npm run gulp compile -- --p <ex-example || THEME> --all 

```
_NB: to remove any extension or all extensions under any site you can use the above commands with **"decompile"**_

> To **deploy** the any of the **extensions** or **themes** to sitecore CMS make sure you are following the below steps:

- You need to configure your **_branding.scss** file with your palette colors. 
- Add your proper extensions needed for this theme
- Compile your theme to get the minified version of css & js code. 
- run one of the below commands to deploy the whole theme as per as your needs 
 
```bash 
##Each of the below commands will show a prompt command line input to insert your credentials. 
gulp deploy --p <THEME> ##This will deploy the whole theme with everything to dev2 server.

## to deploy to specific environment use the --env param as below : 
gulp deploy --p <THEME> --env <dev01||dev02||stg||qa> 

## to deploy to specific files instead of the whole folder your can use the below 
gulp deploy --p <THEME> --files <folder || filepath> 
## You can add multiple folders or files comma separated ex. "folder1,folder2,folder3/file.ext,folder4/file2.ext"

## To get rid of the prompt window for better experience you can use --username and --password params
gulp deploy --p <THEME> --files <folder> --username <un> --password <pwd> --env <key>

```

## Work Plan

For fixing bug in any of the extension themes or any new feature, you need to pull the **development** branch and follow the below naming convention to create a new branch to start development process : 

```sh 
<Base Branch Name> - <type of branch (bugfix || feature || enhancement)> - <Message> 
ex. "development-bugfix-fixingBreadCrumbOnMobile" 
ex. "development-feature-newFloatingBreadCrumb"
ex. "development-enhancement-FloatingBreadCrumbOption"
```

Regarding the **commits** please follow the below naming convention and make sure your are splitting your code into single commits for each extension themes: 

```sh 
<Ext || Theme> - <Extension Name || Theme Name > - <Message> 
ex. "Ext - Footer - fixing accordion panel on desktop" 
ex. "Theme - DefaultSite - Compiling new footer changes"
```

In case of adding any bugfix,feature or enhancement to any of the extension theme we will create a **merge request** to the **development** branch and cherry-pick your commit to your target branch : 

```bash 
git checkout <your-branch> 
git cherry-pick <commit SHA> 
```
